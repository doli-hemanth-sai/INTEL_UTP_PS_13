4. **scripts** - scripts for data preprocessing, data generation, test data sampling for export, etc.
5. **src** - The CLI based code for model inference of the parking space,streamlit  and license plate models.
Part of the main source code of the project. 
6. **test_data** - Test images for testing the license plate and parking detection models
7. **requirements.txt** - The requirements file, containing all dependencies for the project.

### Features ðŸ§ :
Certainly! Here's a summarized version of the features implemented in your intelligent vehicle management system project:

### Project Features 

1. **System Infrastructure:**
   - Deployment of high-resolution cameras and edge AI devices for real-time data processing.

2. **Data Acquisition and Storage:**
   - Establishment of a robust database for storing image data, timestamps, and vehicle information.

3. **Model Development and Optimization:**
   - Implementation of algorithms for analyzing vehicle movement patterns and peak traffic times.
   - Integration of object detection (YOLOv8) for real-time parking occupancy and OCR (easyocr) for license plate recognition.

4. **Real-Time Processing and Monitoring:**
   - Utilization of edge AI devices and video streaming for immediate data analysis.
   - Development of real-time dashboards to monitor vehicle movements and parking occupancy.

5. **Analysis and Predictive Insights:**
   - Application of machine learning models to analyze movement patterns and forecast parking occupancy trends.

6. **Integration for Security and Management:**
   - Unified system integration for comprehensive campus security.
   - Implementation of an alert system for unauthorized vehicle detection and policy development based on data insights.

7. **Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance:**
   - Controlled testing to validate system accuracy and performance.
   - Campus-wide deployment and continuous monitoring to ensure operational efficiency.


### Objectives achieved âœ…: 

1. **Enhanced Campus Security:** By detecting unauthorized vehicles and monitoring movements in real-time.
2. **Improved Management:** Through insights into parking occupancy and traffic patterns.
